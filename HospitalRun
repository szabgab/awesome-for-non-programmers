HospitalRun is a beautiful, easy-to-use hospital management system built for developing world hospitals. The system is a full hospital information system and handles both patient care and the business of running a hospital. Due to the challenges of connectivity in some of the places where these hospitals are located, an important goal of the application is making it work just as well offline as online.
